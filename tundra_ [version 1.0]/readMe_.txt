thank you for using the tundra_ asset pack...part of the fantasy_ series' on itch.io!



stuff to know - tilesets

- each tile is 16 x 16 pixels...although some structures/objcets take up multiple tiles [e.g. fountain, big rock, etc]
- each tileset has a 1 tile [16 pixels] border...although some structures have details that are in the border-tile

stuff to know - animated tiles

- each animated tile has 4 frames
- bridge water animations are in a seperate tileset [tundra_ [bridgeAnimatedTiles] to the static bridge tiles [tundra_ [bridgeHorizontal]]

stuff to know - buildings [currently just the igloo]
